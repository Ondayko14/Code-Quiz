# Code-Quiz
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How it works
Simply load up the website, press start, and answer the questions. Lose 5 seconds and a point for every wrong answer, gain a point for every correct answer. Cannot score less than 0, so don't feel to bad. End score will appear at the end of the quiz. Quiz will end when the clock strikes 0 or all questions have been answered correctly (There are only four). Current Highscore will appear after name insertion.
